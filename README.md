# My CS Journey
<br>
This repository is my personal record of everything I wil learn during my Computer Science degree.
<br>
It serves as a place where I can organize and store all the work I do while studying.
<br>
Inside this repo, I will include all my labs, which are exercises and experiments from my courses.
<br>
These labs help me understand programming concepts, practice problem-solving, and apply what I learn in a practical way.
<br>
I will also add all my projects here.
<br>
Projects are larger assignments or personal coding experiments that let me explore more complex ideas, build applications, or solve real-world problems.
<br>
Each project will be stored in separate foder so I can keep my work organized.
<br>
This way, the repository becomes a complete record of my learning journey.
<br>
Over time, this repository will grow as I complete more labs and projects.
<br>
It is meant to be a living document that reflects my progress and development as a programmer.
